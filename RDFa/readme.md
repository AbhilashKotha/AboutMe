# RDFa to JSON-LD Converter
This script converts RDFa markup in an HTML file to JSON-LD.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo

2. cd into RDFa directory
3. Open converter.html in a browser window
4. Select the RDFa file aboutme_RDFa.html from the same directory

the JSON-LD output file will be downloaded


## Improvements needed:

* More validations to be added for the input
* Support more RDFa features (currently TypeOf and Property are supported)
